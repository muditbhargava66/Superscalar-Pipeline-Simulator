## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this design document is to provide a detailed description of the architecture, design, and implementation of a superscalar pipeline with data forwarding and branch prediction. The document aims to serve as a comprehensive guide for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in understanding the inner workings of a superscalar processor pipeline.

### Scope
The scope of this document covers the design and implementation of a superscalar pipeline simulator that incorporates data forwarding and branch prediction techniques. The simulator focuses on the key components of the pipeline, including instruction fetching, decoding, issuing, execution, memory access, and write-back. It also encompasses the data forwarding unit and branch prediction algorithms.

### Overview
A superscalar pipeline is a high-performance processor architecture that allows multiple instructions to be executed simultaneously in different stages of the pipeline. Data forwarding is a technique used to reduce data dependencies between instructions, enabling faster execution. Branch prediction is employed to minimize the impact of control hazards by predicting the outcome of branch instructions and speculatively executing instructions along the predicted path.

## Architecture

### Pipeline Stages
The superscalar pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. Fetch Stage: Fetches instructions from the instruction cache and predicts branch outcomes.
2. Decode Stage: Decodes instructions and determines their dependencies.
3. Issue Stage: Issues instructions to the appropriate reservation stations.
4. Execute Stage: Executes instructions using functional units.
5. Memory Access Stage: Performs memory read and write operations.
6. Write-Back Stage: Writes the results back to the register file.

### Data Forwarding
Data forwarding is implemented to reduce data dependencies between instructions. When an instruction produces a result that is needed by a subsequent instruction, the result is forwarded directly from the producing stage to the consuming stage, bypassing the need to wait for the result to be written back to the register file.

### Branch Prediction
Branch prediction is employed to minimize the impact of control hazards. The simulator supports various branch prediction algorithms, including:
- Always Taken: Predicts that branches are always taken.
- Gshare: Predicts branch outcomes based on global branch history and branch address.
- Bimodal: Predicts branch outcomes using a saturating counter for each branch.

## Detailed Design

### Fetch Stage
The fetch stage retrieves instructions from the instruction cache based on the program counter (PC). It incorporates branch prediction to predict the outcome of branch instructions and speculatively fetch instructions from the predicted path. The fetched instructions are then passed to the decode stage.

Updates:
- Added support for fetching multiple instructions per cycle based on the fetch bandwidth.
- Implemented an instruction cache to reduce the latency of fetching instructions from memory.
- Integrated branch prediction algorithms to predict branch outcomes and update the PC accordingly.

### Decode Stage
The decode stage decodes the fetched instructions and determines their dependencies. It identifies the source and destination registers, immediate values, and memory addresses required by each instruction. The decoded instructions are then sent to the issue stage.

Updates:
- Enhanced the decoding logic to handle a wider range of instructions and formats.
- Implemented register renaming to eliminate false dependencies and improve parallelism.
- Added support for decoding multiple instructions per cycle.

### Issue Stage
The issue stage assigns instructions to the appropriate reservation stations based on their type and availability of functional units. It implements a dynamic scheduling mechanism, such as Tomasulo's algorithm, to handle out-of-order execution and resolve dependencies.

Updates:
- Improved the issue logic to support multiple reservation stations per functional unit.
- Implemented a load-store queue to handle memory dependencies and ensure correct execution order.
- Added support for issuing multiple instructions per cycle.

### Execute Stage
The execute stage performs the actual execution of instructions using functional units, such as arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and floating-point units (FPUs). It receives instructions from the reservation stations and executes them based on their operands and operation type. The execute stage also handles data forwarding from earlier stages to reduce data dependencies.

Updates:
- Enhanced the execution logic to support a wider range of instructions and operations.
- Implemented a multi-cycle execution model to accommodate instructions with different latencies.
- Improved the data forwarding mechanism to handle forwarding from multiple stages.

### Memory Access Stage
The memory access stage handles memory read and write operations. It interfaces with the data cache to retrieve or store data based on the memory addresses calculated in the execute stage. Memory disambiguation techniques, such as load-store queues, are employed to resolve memory dependencies and ensure correct execution order.

Updates:
- Implemented a data cache to reduce the latency of memory accesses.
- Enhanced the memory access logic to support different memory access patterns and alignments.
- Added support for handling cache misses and memory exceptions.

### Write-Back Stage
The write-back stage updates the register file with the results of executed instructions. It receives the results from the execute stage or the memory access stage and writes them back to the corresponding destination registers. The write-back stage also handles the commitment of instructions in program order.

Updates:
- Improved the write-back logic to support out-of-order commitment of instructions.
- Implemented a reorder buffer to handle the commitment of instructions in program order.
- Added support for handling exceptions and precise interrupts.

### Data Forwarding Unit
The data forwarding unit is responsible for forwarding data between pipeline stages to reduce data dependencies. It monitors the instructions in different stages and identifies opportunities for data forwarding. When a data dependency is detected, the forwarding unit routes the data directly from the producing stage to the consuming stage, eliminating the need for stalls.

Updates:
- Enhanced the data forwarding unit to handle forwarding from multiple stages.
- Improved the forwarding logic to support different data types and sizes.
- Added support for handling forwarding in the presence of exceptions and pipeline flushes.

### Branch Predictors
The branch predictors are used to predict the outcome of branch instructions. Different branch prediction algorithms, such as always taken, gshare, and bimodal, are implemented. The branch predictors utilize branch history tables, pattern history tables, and saturating counters to make accurate predictions. The predicted outcomes are used to speculatively fetch and execute instructions along the predicted path.

Updates:
- Implemented advanced branch prediction algorithms, such as tournament predictors and perceptron predictors.
- Added support for dynamically adapting the branch prediction based on runtime behavior.
- Improved the branch prediction accuracy by incorporating global and local branch history.

## Data Structures

### Instruction
The `Instruction` class represents an instruction in the pipeline. It contains information such as the opcode, operands, destination register, and memory address (if applicable). The instruction also includes fields for tracking its status and dependencies.

Updates:
- Added support for a wider range of instruction formats and fields.
- Improved the instruction encoding and decoding logic.
- Implemented methods for accessing and manipulating instruction fields.

### Reservation Station
The `ReservationStation` class represents a reservation station in the issue stage. It holds instructions that are waiting to be executed and tracks their operands and dependencies. The reservation station communicates with the functional units to dispatch instructions for execution when their operands are available.

Updates:
- Enhanced the reservation station to support multiple functional units.
- Improved the logic for tracking operand availability and dispatching instructions.
- Added support for handling load and store instructions in the reservation station.

### Reorder Buffer
The `ReorderBuffer` class is used to maintain the program order of instructions and handle out-of-order execution. It keeps track of the instructions in the pipeline and their completion status. The reorder buffer ensures that instructions are committed in program order, even if they are executed out of order.

Updates:
- Improved the reorder buffer to support precise exceptions and interrupts.
- Added support for handling branch mispredictions and pipeline flushes.
- Implemented methods for committing instructions and updating the architectural state.

### Register File
The `RegisterFile` class represents the physical register file in the processor. It contains the actual values of the registers and provides methods for reading and writing register values. The register file is updated during the write-back stage.

Updates:
- Added support for register renaming and mapping logical registers to physical registers.
- Improved the register allocation and deallocation logic.
- Implemented methods for handling register dependencies and forwarding.

## Algorithms

### Tomasulo's Algorithm
Tomasulo's algorithm is used for dynamic scheduling and out-of-order execution in the issue stage. It utilizes reservation stations and a common data bus to handle dependencies and enable parallel execution of instructions. The algorithm assigns instructions to reservation stations, monitors the availability of operands, and dispatches instructions for execution when their operands are ready.

Updates:
- Enhanced Tomasulo's algorithm to support multiple functional units and reservation stations.
- Improved the handling of load and store instructions in the algorithm.
- Added support for precise exceptions and interrupts in the algorithm.

### Branch Prediction Algorithms
Various branch prediction algorithms are implemented to predict the outcome of branch instructions. The always taken predictor predicts that branches are always taken. The gshare predictor uses global branch history and branch address to make predictions. The bimodal predictor employs saturating counters for each branch to predict their outcomes.

Updates:
- Implemented advanced branch prediction algorithms, such as tournament predictors and perceptron predictors.
- Added support for dynamically adapting the branch prediction based on runtime behavior.
- Improved the branch prediction accuracy by incorporating global and local branch history.

## Control Flow

### Pipeline Stalls
Pipeline stalls occur when dependencies or resource conflicts prevent instructions from proceeding to the next stage. Stalls are handled by introducing bubbles in the pipeline and halting the progress of dependent instructions until the dependencies are resolved. Data forwarding and out-of-order execution help in reducing pipeline stalls.

Updates:
- Improved the stall detection and handling logic to minimize performance impact.
- Added support for dynamic stall resolution based on runtime conditions.
- Implemented techniques like instruction reordering and register renaming to reduce stalls.

### Branch Misprediction Handling
When a branch is mispredicted, the pipeline needs to be flushed, and execution should resume from the correct path. The simulator implements a mechanism to detect branch mispredictions, flush the speculatively executed instructions, and redirect the pipeline to the correct path. The branch predictor is updated based on the actual outcome of the branch.

Updates:
- Enhanced the branch misprediction handling to support precise exceptions and interrupts.
- Improved the pipeline flushing and redirection logic to minimize performance overhead.
- Added support for selective flushing of instructions based on their dependencies.

## Performance Optimizations

### Instruction Cache
An instruction cache is implemented to reduce the latency of fetching instructions from memory. The cache stores frequently accessed instructions and provides fast access to them, minimizing the impact of memory latency on the pipeline.

Updates:
- Improved the cache replacement policy to optimize cache utilization.
- Added support for cache prefetching to reduce cache misses.
- Implemented cache coherence protocols to maintain consistency with other caches.

### Data Cache
A data cache is employed to speed up memory read and write operations. The cache stores recently accessed data and provides fast access to it, reducing the latency of memory accesses. Cache coherence protocols are implemented to maintain consistency between the cache and main memory.

Updates:
- Enhanced the cache hierarchy to include multiple levels of caches (L1, L2, etc.).
- Improved the cache replacement policy and cache line selection algorithm.
- Added support for cache prefetching and speculative execution.

### Branch Target Buffer
A branch target buffer (BTB) is used to store the target addresses of previously executed branch instructions. The BTB is accessed in parallel with the instruction cache to quickly predict the target of a branch instruction, reducing the penalty of branch mispredictions.

Updates:
- Increased the size and associativity of the BTB to improve prediction accuracy.
- Implemented advanced BTB replacement policies to optimize BTB utilization.
- Added support for dynamically updating the BTB based on runtime branch behavior.

## Error Handling
The simulator includes error handling mechanisms to detect and handle various types of errors, such as:
- Invalid instructions
- Illegal memory accesses
- Division by zero
- Overflow and underflow conditions

When an error is detected, the simulator raises an exception and terminates the execution gracefully, providing appropriate error messages and diagnostics.

Updates:
- Enhanced the error handling mechanism to support precise exceptions and interrupts.
- Improved the error reporting and logging functionality for better debugging.
- Added support for user-defined error handlers and exception handling routines.

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are implemented to verify the correctness of individual components and modules of the superscalar pipeline simulator. Each component, such as the pipeline stages, data forwarding unit, and branch predictors, is tested in isolation to ensure their proper functionality.

Updates:
- Expanded the unit test coverage to include corner cases and boundary conditions.
- Implemented automated test generation and execution using testing frameworks.
- Added support for continuous integration and regression testing.

### Integration Tests
Integration tests are conducted to validate the interaction and coordination between different components of the pipeline. These tests focus on the overall behavior of the simulator and ensure that instructions are correctly fetched, decoded, issued, executed, and written back.

Updates:
- Enhanced the integration tests to cover a wider range of instruction sequences and program flows.
- Implemented end-to-end tests to validate the correctness of the entire pipeline.
- Added support for testing different pipeline configurations and parameters.

### Performance Tests
Performance tests are carried out to evaluate the efficiency and performance characteristics of the superscalar pipeline simulator. These tests measure metrics such as instructions per cycle (IPC), branch prediction accuracy, and execution time for various benchmarks and workloads.

Updates:
- Expanded the performance test suite to include industry-standard benchmarks and workloads.
